            <p>Impressionism is an art movement that originated during the 19th century, mostly in France. 
                It is known for capturing the effects of light and atmosphere. The movement marked a significant departure 
                from tradional academic painting styles at the time. Paintings during this movement had thin, small,
                 yet visible brush strokes.</p>

<h2> Woman With A Parasol</h2>
        <div class="2nd article to be highlighted">
            <p>Monet uses light, impulsive brushstrokes to add color splashes. The wind is blowing Mrs. Monet's veil and her billowing white dress;
                 the green bottom of her parasol echoes the meadow's waving grass. With a powerful upward viewpoint and appearing as though from below,
                  she is viewed against fluffy white clouds against an azure sky. In order to provide depth, a boy—Jan, Monet's seven-year-old son—is positioned farther away, 
                  hidden behind a hill in the landscape and only visible from the waist up.
                 Monet used bold, lively brushstrokes to capture the fleeting nature of the moment.</p>

            <p>Impressionism got its when the title that Claude Monet gave to one of his paintings is where the word "impressionism" first appeared. It was a whimsical
                 choice that happened in an instant, fitting the name of a kind of art that concentrates on capturing transient moments.</p>
